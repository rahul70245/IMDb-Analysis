# IMDb-Analysis
Technology used in this analysis project is Power BI. For doing this project I have taken raw data from IMDb site. It has 18 columns and approximately 3000 rows. In this first thing I did was to
clean the data properly as it was raw unclean data and had many duplicacy issues and some date issues. The objective was to analyse the movies profit and budget and find the popular movies. It is a 
self-learning project.
